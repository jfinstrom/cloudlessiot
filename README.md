# CloudlessIOT

## What?

A Cloudless IOT manager with FreePBX® that operates through the OpenHAB® API to manage devices without the need for any cloud services

## Why?

Ummmmm Why not. I have multiple IOT devices from multiple manufacturers and all require a cloud service. It is kind of obnoxous.
